Quiz Software For Kids (Math)

* Test your kids math skill every 10 minutes while they using pc for playing, for example.

Application opens in full screen mode and prevents simple way to close, for example Alt+F4 and by clicking on X. Its randomly selects one of math tasks ( multiplication , addition , divide , subtraction ). You need to write correct answer to close the app. After 10 minutes its opens again and shows you another random task. 

This application was developed especially for my son. He is 8 years old. And he is my beta-tester :) 

Why i'm using Visual Basic? Because my son is interested in software development and it is simple for understanding.

To compile project you need VB2010 and above. 
You can get latest binaries in Debug folder.

In feature i'm plan to make C# version of this software
